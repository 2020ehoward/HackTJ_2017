This is a data visualization software that takes in excel files with some variable tracked over time and by country, and you can view trends across time and regions.
A suggested repository for example data is www.gapminder.org/data/, and that will show you the accepted format.
The data also must be in terms of percentages or out of 100.
You can adjust the slider to change the viewed year or press the start/stop button to cycle through the years automatically.
On top, the title of the data is written, if there is one, and if you press the file button you can navigate to more data sources.
We have included some example data in the data folder
